### ðŸ‘‰ðŸ˜ŽðŸ‘‰

My name is **Shawn McGee (He/Him)** and I am a full-time father, a part-time DM, and a some-time programmer with big dreams.

> I am a technically-minded, family-oriented self-starter with an innate ability to master new skills quickly and I especially enjoy designing solutions to novel challenges.

When I am not putting out ðŸ”¥ at home or at work, I am working on:

- [Jasper](https://github.com/shawn-mcgee/jasper): A Java game engine for Desktop
- [Daedalus](https://github.com/shawn-mcgee/daedalus): A Virtual Table Top for *the modern era*
- [Paperize.io](https://github.com/paperize/paperize): Helping designers make better games, faster!
